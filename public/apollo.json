Known as the 'Apollo-Soyuz Test Project' (ASTP) in the United States and as 'Experimental Programme-Apollo-Soyuz' (EPAS) in the Soviet Union, this joint space flight is considered as signalling an end to the Space Race which began in 1957 and also a sign of d?tente between the two Cold War Superpowers.    \n\nEPAS cologne was a 'limited edition' production with the Soviet Union and each country in which Revlon had a subsidiary was given an allocation of the fragrances for distribution. Revlon offices throughout the world arranged public relations functions to coincide with the space mission and the launching of the perfume, which was only available for a short period, during and after the Apollo-Soyuz mission. According to Mr. Austin, Managing Director of Revlon Australia at the time, the fragrance was 'launched' in Australia on July 17, 1975, two days after the mission began, the promotional function being attended by consular representatives of the US and USSR. A press release relating to this launch states that the product was developed 'Following the example set by the two governments and consistent with the fellowship implicit in man's grand exploration of space'. This cologne was purchased by the donor from the MYER department store, Tweed Heads on July 23, 1975. The purchase price was $17.50. \n\nThe EPAS cologne joint venture was one of a number of similar 'joint ventures' in various industries between the USA and USSR, all of which were intended as Apollo-Soyuz commemorative projects. Joint ventures such as this are significant, considering the two countries' historically tumultuous relationship, and the so-called 'Space Race' which had involved cultural, technological and political rivalry during the first decades of the exploration of outer space. The Space Race was an important propaganda tool of the Cold War, in which the US and USSR each sought to establish their ideological supremacy by demonstrating their technological superiority in the high technology arena of space exploration. The cessation of overt competition in space, as symbolised in the Apollo-Soyuz mission, was an important step on the road to political d?tente between the major powers as the Cold War thawed during the 1970s.   \n\nThe Apollo-Soyuz commemorative cologne is an example of how space travel has captured public imagination, particularly during the 1960s and 1970s. Space travel is one of humanity's most significant technological achievements, and this commemorative cologne reflects the popularity and esteem in which such developments are held.","display_location_building":"Powerhouse Discovery Centre, Castle Hill","multimedia_uri":"/api/v1/item/211455/multimedia/json/?api_key=651770a0533e4d0","title":"Commemorative cologne bottle and packaging","dimensions":{"diameter":null,"weight":null,"height":"198 mm","width":"87 mm"},"num_provenance":6,"tags":["order cologne apooly","order tag wildcard tag"],"provenance":[{"name":"","date_latest":"1977","role":"","date_range":null,"date_earliest":"1975","place":"Tweed Heads, New South Wales"},{"name":"","date_latest":"1977","role":"Owner","date_range":null,"date_earliest":"1975","place":"Tweed Heads, New South Wales"},{"name":"Revlon","date_latest":"1975","role":"Maker","date_range":null,"date_earliest":"1975","place":"New York, New York, USA"},{"name":"Novaya Zaria Factory","date_latest":"","role":"Maker","date_range":null,"date_earliest":"","place":"Moscow, USSR"},{"name":"Revlon","date_latest":"1975","role":"Maker","date_range":null,"date_earliest":"1975","place":"New York, New York, USA"},{"name":"Revlon","date_latest":"1975","role":"Maker","date_range":null,"date_earliest":"1975","place":"Moscow, USSR"}],"id":211455,"num_multimedia":20,"administrative_history":null,"display_location":"Display Store","production_notes":"The cologne was produced as a joint venture between Revlon, USA and Novaya Zaria Perfume Factory in Moscow, USSR to commemorate the international cooperation in space with the joint USA/USSR Apollo-Soyuz space mission.

Two events were held at the museum, a public lecture (12/7/94) and a schools' program which included a satellite link to the United States (13/7/94).  Astronaut John Young was NASA's official representative and speaker at both events and presented the plaque to the Curator of Space Technology at the conclusion of the lecture on 12 July.  John Young was in Australia as part of an Apollo-11 celebration week held in Sydney and Canberra between July 11 and 16.  This week was held to mark the significant contribution of Australia's NASA tracking stations to the success of the Apollo 11 mission.  John Young is NASA's most experienced astronaut, having made six space flights in three different types of spacecraft: 2 Gemini flights, 2 Apollo flights (both of which went to the Moon) and 2 Space Shuttle flights (including the first launch of the Shuttle).  NASA routinely presents plaques of this sort to the host organisation whenever an astronaut or other NASA representative makes an official visit.  They are considered an important public relations tool, offered in recognition of the host institution's support for NASA and the US space program. Each presentation plaque is customised to the person or institution receiving it.","item_uri":"/api/v1/item/141195/json/?api_key=651770a0533e4d0","significance_statement":"This presentation plaque was an official gift to the Powerhouse Museum from NASA, acknowledging the Museum's role in promoting space awareness and education. It was presented to the Museum by NASA astronaut John Young during the week in July 1994 celebrating the 25th anniversary of the first lunar landing, Apollo 11. \n\nOn 21 July 1969 (Australian time; it was still July 20 in the United States) Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on the moon. Armstrong spoke the now famous words: '\"That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind\". The Museum's celebrations during the 25th Anniversary highlighted the achievement of Apollo 11, along with the significant contribution made by NASA tracking stations in Australia to the success of the mission. The Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station, near Canberra, received the first images of Armstrong stepping onto the lunar surface.\n\nJohn Young was the official NASA Astronaut representative in Australia for the 25th anniversary celebrations. He has had a distinguished career with NASA, commencing as an astronaut in 1962. He flew missions in the Gemini (GT-3, GT-10), Apollo (Apollo 10, Apollo 16) and Shuttle (STS-1, STS-9) programs, becoming the first person to make six space flights. He was also the first person to travel twice to the Moon, as Command Module Pilot on Apollo 10 and Mission Commander on Apollo 16, and the 9th person to walk on the lunar surface. He retired from NASA in 2004.\n\nSpace travel is one of humanity's most significant technological achievements and the Apollo 11 Moon mission was a momentous accomplishment: the first time human beings had set foot on another world. This plaque acknowledges the Museum's leading role in Australia in educating the public about this important field of human endeavour through its Space exhibition and public programs.","display_location_building":null,"multimedia_uri":"/api/v1/item/141195/multimedia/json/?api_key=651770a0533e4d0","title":null,"dimensions":{"diameter":null,"weight":null,"height":"407 mm","width":"509 mm"},"num_provenance":8,"tags":[],"provenance":[{"name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration","date_latest":"1994","role":"User","date_range":null,"date_earliest":"1994","place":"Sydney"},{"name":"Young, John","date_latest":"","role":"User","date_range":null,"date_earliest":"","place":""},{"name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration","date_latest":"1994","role":"User","date_range":null,"date_earliest":"1994","place":"Sydney"},{"name":"Young, John","date_latest":"1994","role":"User","date_range":null,"date_earliest":"1994","place":"Sydney"},{"name":"NASA Public Affairs Office","date_latest":"1994","role":"Designer","date_range":null,"date_earliest":"1994","place":"Houston, Texas, USA"},{"name":"NASA Public Affairs Office","date_latest":"","role":"Maker","date_range":null,"date_earliest":"","place":"Houston, Texas, USA"},{"name":"NASA Public Affairs Office","date_latest":"","role":"Designer","date_range":null,"date_earliest":"","place":"Houston, Texas, USA"},{"name":"NASA Public Affairs Office","date_latest":"1994","role":"Maker","date_range":null,"date_earliest":"1994","place":"Houston, Texas, USA"}],"id":141195,"num_multimedia":1,"administrative_history":null,"display_location":null,"production_notes":"This plaque was designed by the NASA Public Affairs Office at the Lyndon B.

It prepared the way for the extensive empire soon to be wrested from the Persians by his son, Alexander the Great (reigned 336-323). During Philip's life however, there were other achievements of which he was proud, and winning at Olympia justly ranked high among them. In 352 Philip won the tethrippon, a four horse chariot race, and in 348 BC the synoris, a race for chariots pulled by a pair of horses. He had also won the horse race earlier in 356 BC. These Olympic victories were so prestigious that Philip II issued coins depicting the events, and this gold stater features the two-horse chariot of his synoris win in 348 BC.\n\nThe reverse of the coin features the chariot racing to the right with the charioteer coiled within the rim of the coin, and his whip beating upon the horses in a gallop to the finish. Just visible at the top is the victory wreath symbolising that this was no ordinary chariot, but an Olympic winner. In the exergue (below the ground line) is the name, Philip, and below the horse is a serpent and the monogram A and Pi, identifying for the ancients where it was minted (probably Pella, the capital of Macedon). On the obverse is the laureate (wreathed) head of the quintessential Greek god, Apollo.\n\nThis type of coin was actually issued long after Philip II's death and perpetuates the same coin design minted by him after his chariot victory. This particular example was minted during the rule of Philip III Arrhidaeus (reigned 323-317 BC). Such continuity is economically understandable for a coin widely recognised and trusted as far as northern Europe where the Celts imitated the design, and continued to do so for hundreds of years. Also, coins were excellent propaganda, and perpetuating a prestigious Olympic victory was as logical for Philip's successors as it was for Philip himself, who Plutarch (Alexander 4) says was personally responsible for the designs of his coins. Philip II had territorial ambitions that he passed onto his son.

Twelve engines of this type were used on the Apollo CM, being divided into two sub-systems of six motors each. One system was the prime manoeuvring system, with the second being used as a backup in case of failure. Both systems were activiated just prior to the Command Module's separation from the Service Module, as it approached the Earth in preparation for re-entry.\nThe provenance of this particular engine prior to its appearance at the Christie's sale is unknown.

It returned to Earth on December 28, after becoming the first crewed spacecraft to orbit the Moon.  Apollo space food menus, like those for Gemini flights, were planned on the basis of four meals per day (again designated A, B, C, D), with the menu repeating after four days. Prior to each flight the crew selected their individual meal preferences from the available range. The aluminium foil meal package wrapper was stamped with the day and meal codes and wrapped with a colour-coded ribbon tab which identified the astronaut whose meal it was.  Meals and their associated hygiene equipment (chewing gum, toothbrush, wet and dry cleansing cloths) were stored in fireproof containers onboard the spacecraft in the order in which they were to be used.  On Apollo missions, a supply of supplementary meals and individual food items was included, so that astronauts could, if they wished, snack between meals or change their mind about their original meal choices and select an alternative from this supply. This meal was possibly an original meal choice discarded by the astronaut in favour of an item from the supplementary supply. The individual items in each meal were prepared for eating according to their processed form. The Apollo Command Module was equipped to supply hot water at 67 C or chilled water at 7 C which produced better-tasting reconstituted food and drink than the tepid water on Gemini flights.  At the time of the Apollo 8 flight, rehydratable foods were stored in sachets like those used on Gemini missions and they were prepared and eaten in the same way.  A paper label on each food sachet told the astronaut how much hot or cold water to add to prepare the meal.  'Wetpack' meals were simply cut open and eaten with a spoon that was supplied attached to the food packet. (On later flights contains similar to those for 'wetpacks' were used for rehydratable foods).  Drinks were supplied as pre-mixed powders, stored in 'concertina'-shaped plastic cylinders with valved, straw-shaped necks.  Hot or cold water would be added through the valved drinking straw to produce cordials, juices, coffee or tea.\n\nAccording to the vendor, this meal was at one time in a museum collection (museum unidentified), to which it would have been donated by NASA after the completion of the Apollo 8 flight, or at the conclusion of the Apollo program.  It was then sold by the museum to a private collector, from whom the current vendor purchased it.","item_uri":"/api/v1/item/147964/json/?api_key=651770a0533e4d0","significance_statement":"This type of meal package was developed for the Apollo program, the third US crewed spaceflight program (1968-1972).  This six-item dinner meal was flown on the Apollo 8 mission, which was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit the Moon. Apollo 8 was launched December 21 1968 and returned to Earth on December 28. The crew were: Commander Frank Borman, Command Module Pilot James Lovell and Lunar Module Pilot William Anders.  \n\nBecause of the unique environment of space, food for spaceflight has to satisfy a number of criteria in order to fulfil its function as nutrition for astronauts. Apollo space food provided the complete nutritional requirements for each astronaut for up to two weeks in space, including the replacement of those minerals and vitamins lost from the body under microgravity conditions. The food was designed to be lightweight and compact, stored without refrigeration, able to be safely handled and consumed under weightless conditions, able to withstand severe thermal and mechanical stresses. It also had to be low residue, to reduce the astronauts' bowel movements, as waste disposal was a problem on early space flights.\n \nWhile similar to the food used on earlier Gemini spaceflight, Apollo food was further improved as a result of additional research and refinements in the food processing techniques. The availability of hot and cold water in the Apollo Command Module enabled NASA food technicians to expand the range of bite-size and rehydrateable foods available to the astronauts and the controlled water temperature for meal rehydration greatly improved the palatability of Apollo food over that used on Gemini flights. The Apollo 8 flight saw the introduction of the 'wetpack', a thermally stabilised meal item that was in its natural form, with full moisture content, and eaten with a spoon. \n\nSpace food is designed to provide sustenance to astronauts in an environment where they could not naturally find food. It is an example of the human capacity to develop foodstuffs to enable people to occupy diverse and often harsh environments. This meal package is part of a collection of space food meal packages that show the development of space food production and storage techniques in the US and Soviet space programs. \n\nThe Apollo 8 mission was significant not only because it was the first time that human beings had orbited the Moon, but also because Apollo 8 images of the Earth rising over the Moon and sitting isolated in space became important in encouraging the growth of environmental awareness. Seeing the entire Earth from the vantage point of space for the first time, through the images from Apollo 8 and later Apollo missions, gave rise to the environmentally important concept of \"Spaceship Earth\" and helped foster the environmental consciousness and the Green movement. Two Apollo missions took place in Earth orbit, the rest involved journeys to the Moon, lasting up to 12 days.","display_location_building":"Powerhouse Museum, Ultimo","multimedia_uri":"/api/v1/item/147964/multimedia/json/?api_key=651770a0533e4d0","title":"Space meal package with envelope","dimensions":{"diameter":null,"weight":null,"height":null,"width":"100 mm"},"num_provenance":0,"tags":[],"provenance":[],"id":147964,"num_multimedia":1,"administrative_history":null,"display_location":"Space Exhibition","production_notes":"Apollo space food was similar to the earlier Gemini food, but further improved as a result of additional research and refinements in the food processing techniques.

The first 'wetpack' meal was turkey with gravy and cranberry/apple sauce, eaten on Christmas Eve in orbit around the Moon. The sticky gravies and sauces in 'wetpack' meals were used as 'glue' to keep the food in its container and hold it to the spoon. Improved packaging techniques enabled the development of a more compact meal package for easier storage and greater food longevity. Apollo meal menus were designed to provide the astronauts with 11,720 kilojoules per man daily, with the nutritional content balanced to provide 20% protein, 62% carbohydrates and 18% fats. The caloric distribution was the same as for Gemini food.\n\nLike Gemini space food, Apollo meal items were manufactured by various commercial food companies, working to NASA food specifications. The same processes were used as for Gemini food, with the techniques refined by further testing and experience.  A new food preparation technique that was developed for Apollo was thermal stabilisation, in which full-moisture-content foods were heat-treated to destroy bacteria, while retaining their natural shape, colour and texture. This technique was also transferred to the commercial food processing industry.\n\nThis meal was flown in space in 1968 and would have been manufactured within that year, as Apollo 8 was only the second crewed Apollo mission.","registration_number":"95/48/2","summary":"95/48/2 Meal package, space food for Apollo 8 mission, food / plastic / metal, maker unknown, USA, 1968","categories":["Food and Drink","Space Technology"],"acquisition_credit_line":"Purchased 1995","description":"Meal package and envelope, space food for Apollo 8 mission, food / plastic / metal, maker unknown, United States of America, 1968\n\nSealed clear plastic package containing five food items and one drink.
